* renamed all references to "MetaData" to "Metadata"


Changes in version 1.3.3.1 (21.12.2010)
-------------------------------------

* added optional namespace argument to Type.getMethod() and Type.getField() methods
* fixed critical bug in type JSON reflection where only methods and accessors of the subclass were added to the type instead of all.

-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------

* critical bugfix


Changes in version 1.3.1 (29.08.2010)
-------------------------------------

Package org.as3commons.reflect
* added support for type.getMetaDataContainers("MetadataName") to quickly retrieve all members that are decorated with specific metadata
* added support for Type.alias property. When registerClassAlias() has been invoked for a Class, the value of this alias will be stored in the Type.alias property. This will not work if registerClassAlias() has been called AFTER the Type has been created already. In that case, call Type.clearCache() and retrieve the Type again.
* added findClassMetadata() and findMetadataDeclaringClass() methods to MetadataUtils (thanks Andy Lewisohn)
* added INamespaceOwner interface that is implemented by method and member classes
* added support to MethodInvoker to invoke methods on an object in a custom namespace

* fixed ClassUtils.forName() call where no appropriate applicationDomain was passed in
* fixed issue: http://code.google.com/p/as3-commons/issues/detail?id=21 (thanks Arnoud)
