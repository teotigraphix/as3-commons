AS3COMMONS-EVENTBUS CHANGELOG
=============================

Note: dates are in DD.MM.YYYY format

Changes in version 1.3 (??.??.2012)

* Split the IEventBus interface into an ISimpleEventBus interface that only supports the regular event dispatching, all interception logic now resides in IEventBus
* Added StaticSimpleEventbus, similar to StaticEventbus but is a static version of the ISimpleEventBus interface
* Added optional topic argument to IEventInterceptor and IEventListenerInterceptor methods
* Added EventListenerGuardian class (to automatically remove listeners after an event has been dispatched a specified amount of times)

Changes in version 1.2.0 (22.03.2012)
-------------------------------------

* Moved WeakLinkedList from as3commons-collections to -eventbus
* Added a check to the onEvent handler that confirms that the given event wasn't dispatched by the current Eventbus, this is to prevent loops between linked eventbuses.
* Exposed internal eventbus instance of the StaticEventBus (that way the static bus can be added as a listener to a regular EventBus instance)

------------------------------------

General
