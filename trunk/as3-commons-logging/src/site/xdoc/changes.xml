        <section name="Important Changes in v2.5">
             <ul>
                 <li>For performance reasons were changed the access to loggers,
                     instead of the former common: <pre class="source">logger.info("{0}*{0}={1}", 3, 9);</pre>
                     we now use the a lot faster syntax (performance-wise) 
                     <pre class="source">logger.info("{0}*{0}={1}", [3, 9]);</pre>
                     to make sure that you have the fastest logging at your finger
                     tips.
                     <br/>
                     As this breaks with the existing API we decided to move
                     the API methods from <code>org.as3commons.logging</code>
                     to <code>org.as3commons.logging.api</code>!<br/>
                     <br/>
                     If you dont want to change your code, feel free to use
                     additionally this swc that contains a wrapper for the old api:
                     <a href="downloads/as3commons-logging-2.legacy.swc">as3commons-logging-2.legacy.swc</a><br/>

                 </li>
                 <li>
                     By default the logging framework does <strong>not</strong> render statements
                     to <code>trace</code> anymore. This has been made to ensure
                     that at deploy-time the logging consumes as few resources
                     as necessary.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     The former deprecated <code>LoggerFactory.getNamedLogger</code>
                     and <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger</code> have been dumped to
                     enforce our police of not keeping legacy code for too long.

                 <li>
                     The former suggested way of requesting a logger via
                     <code>LoggerFactory.getNamedLogger</code> was deprecated
                     in favor of <code>getLogger</code>
                 </li>
             </ul>
